PLUGGABLE READERS AND WRITERS - AUDIO EXPLANATION

Your idea is to allow users to specify custom readers for source connectors and custom writers for target connectors. Currently, Dativo provides Python defaults, but users could bring high-performance implementations in Rust, Go, or C++.

THE SIMPLE EXPLANATION

Think of Dativo like a delivery truck moving data. Today, everyone uses our standard Python truck. It works, but it's not super fast. Your idea: let users bring their own truck. Need to move a lot of data? Bring a semi-truck - that's Rust code, 10 times faster. Need special security? Bring an armored truck - that's a custom encrypted writer. The system still handles route planning and scheduling, but you control the vehicle.

THE TECHNICAL PROBLEM

Python has three limitations. First, performance ceiling. Python is limited by the GIL, the Global Interpreter Lock. For 1 million rows from Postgres: Python takes 100 seconds, Rust takes 10 seconds - 10 times slower. For 1 terabyte per day, Python costs 18 thousand dollars per year in compute, Rust costs 1,800 dollars. That's 16 thousand dollars wasted annually.

Second, no custom security. Healthcare and finance need client-side encryption before cloud upload, HSM integration, custom audit trails. Currently impossible to add these.

Third, proprietary sources. Companies have mainframe databases, custom APIs, 40-year-old legacy systems. Can't create connectors for these today.

THE SOLUTION

Pluggable architecture. Users implement five simple methods: initialize, read batch, get schema, get incremental state, and close. Dativo handles everything else - scheduling, retries, monitoring, metadata, catalog updates.

The flow: User writes a Rust reader, builds it into a Python wheel, specifies it in the job YAML config. Dativo loads it, calls the methods, gets Apache Arrow RecordBatches with zero-copy performance. Result: 10 times faster, but Dativo still manages orchestration.

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES

Example one: ShopCo, e-commerce, 1 terabyte per day. Currently takes 10 hours with Python, costs 18 thousand per year. With Rust reader: 1 hour ingestion, 1,800 dollars per year cost, 16 thousand dollars saved annually, 10 times fresher data. They could run hourly instead of daily.

Example two: HealthTech, patient data. HIPAA requires client-side encryption. Currently blocked from using Dativo because data is briefly unencrypted. Solution: Custom encrypted writer. Data encrypted before S3 upload, never unencrypted in cloud. Result: HIPAA compliant, 100 thousand dollar per year customer, unlocks 20 million dollar healthcare market.

Example three: DataPlatform Inc building internal platform. Have 5 existing Go readers, don't want to rewrite in Python. Solution: Wrap Go readers with gRPC interface. Result: Reuse existing code, get Dativo orchestration, save 6 months of work, 50 thousand dollar per year customer.

WHY THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY

Four reasons.

First, performance. Python: 100 seconds, 2 gigabytes memory, 80% CPU, 100 megabytes per second throughput. Rust: 10 seconds, 500 megabytes memory, 40% CPU, 1 gigabyte per second throughput. 10 times faster, 4 times less memory, 2 times more efficient. Customer savings: 16 thousand dollars per year on compute alone.

Second, enterprise customization. Before: can't modify code for custom security, no HSM, no air-gap. After: build custom writer, your HSM, your network. Impact: unlock 20 million dollar regulated market.

Third, ecosystem. Vision: Dativo connector marketplace. Community readers like rust-postgres free and open source. Commercial connectors like SAP for 499 per month. Dativo takes 30% commission. 20 connectors times 100 per month average times 30% equals 72 thousand per year. Scale to 100 connectors: 360 thousand per year in marketplace revenue. Network effects: more readers attract more users, more users attract more customers, more customers fund more community readers. Virtuous cycle to market leadership.

Fourth, competitive moat. Comparison: Dativo would have pluggable readers yes, pluggable writers yes, performance optimization 10 times, multiple languages yes, in-process fast yes, marketplace planned. Airbyte: no, no, no, limited, no, limited. Fivetran: all no. Meltano: partial but slow for readers and writers, rest no. Verdict: Dativo would be the ONLY platform with fast language-agnostic pluggable readers and writers. Time advantage: 6 to 12 months before competitors can copy. By then we'll have 20 plus marketplace connectors, strong ecosystem, network effects making us the standard.

BUSINESS IMPACT

Three customer segments, 52.5 million dollar total addressable market.

Segment one: High-volume enterprises, 30% of market. 1 terabyte plus daily, need 10 times performance, willing to pay 75 thousand versus 50 thousand. 300 potential customers, 22.5 million dollar market.

Segment two: Regulated industries, 40% of market. Healthcare finance government, need custom compliance, willing to pay 100 thousand versus 50 thousand. 200 potential customers, 20 million dollar market.

Segment three: Platform teams, 20% of market. Have existing Go Rust connectors, need extensibility, standard 50 thousand pricing. 200 potential customers, 10 million dollar market.

Revenue projections. Year one conservative: 10 high-volume at 75 thousand equals 750 thousand, 5 regulated at 100 thousand equals 500 thousand, 10 platform teams at 50 thousand equals 500 thousand. Total 1.75 million annual recurring revenue.

Year two with marketplace: 1.75 million organic plus 72 thousand marketplace plus 9 thousand certified partners. Total 2.25 million annual recurring revenue.

Year three at scale: 2.5 million organic plus 500 thousand marketplace. Total 3 million plus annual recurring revenue.

Investment required. Development one-time: 1 senior engineer 8 weeks at 30 thousand plus QA and docs 10 thousand equals 40 thousand total. Ongoing annual: 10 thousand maintenance plus 20 thousand support equals 30 thousand per year.

Return on investment. Year one: 1.75 million revenue divided by 40 thousand investment equals 43 to 1. Year two: 2.25 million divided by 30 thousand equals 75 to 1. Three year total: 7 million revenue divided by 100 thousand investment equals 70 to 1.

Customer value. High-volume: 16 thousand compute savings, 9 hours per day time savings, 10 times better freshness, willing to pay 75 thousand for 5 times ROI on compute alone. Regulated: unblocked from compliance issues, no violation risk, complete audit trail, willing to pay 100 thousand to avoid manual scripts. Platform teams: 6 months work saved, single platform standardization, future-proof any language, willing to pay 50 thousand cheaper than building in-house.

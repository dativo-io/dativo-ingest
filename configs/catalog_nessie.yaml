# Nessie Catalog Configuration Example
# Note: Nessie lineage/metadata is handled via Iceberg table properties
# This is mainly for consistency with other catalog integrations
# Reference this in job configs with:
# catalog:
#   type: nessie

type: nessie
# Nessie configuration is handled via target.connection.nessie in job config

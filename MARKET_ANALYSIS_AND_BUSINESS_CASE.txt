================================================================================
3. GAPS IN CURRENT MARKET NEEDS
================================================================================

3.1 NO UNIFIED DATA + ML PIPELINE
----------------------------------
Current State:
  Data Ingestion (Airbyte) → Feature Store (Tecton) → ML Platform (SageMaker)
  - 3 separate tools, 2 handoffs
  - Different teams, different vendors
  - No end-to-end lineage

Problems:
  - Training data ≠ serving data (skew)
  - Features computed inconsistently
  - Can't reproduce training runs
  - Debugging is nightmare

Market Need:
  Single platform: Data → Features → Training → Serving
  With lineage, versioning, and drift detection


3.2 DATA QUALITY IS BOLT-ON, NOT BUILT-IN
------------------------------------------
Current State:
  ETL tool writes data → Separate quality tool checks it later
  - Quality issues discovered after ingestion
  - Bad data already in warehouse/lake
  - No enforcement at ingestion time

Problems:
  - ML models trained on bad data
  - BI dashboards show wrong metrics
  - Debugging takes hours/days
  - No proactive prevention

Market Need:
  Quality checks DURING ingestion with contracts
  Block/quarantine bad data before it propagates


3.3 COMPLIANCE OPERATIONS ARE MANUAL
-------------------------------------
Current State:
  GDPR request arrives → Manual process:
  1. Engineer searches all data stores (days)
  2. Manually exports data (hours)
  3. Manually deletes from tables (hours)
  4. Hope you didn't miss anything (liability)

Problems:
  - Takes 2-4 weeks (GDPR requires <30 days)
  - Human error (incomplete deletion)
  - No audit trail
  - Legal liability (€20M fines)

Market Need:
  Automated DSR operations with proof of completion
  Immutable audit trail for compliance


3.4 METADATA MANAGEMENT IS DISCONNECTED
----------------------------------------
Current State:
  Ingestion tool → Manual catalog updates → OpenMetadata
  - Metadata stale immediately
  - Lineage tracked separately
  - Quality scores not published

Problems:
  - Can't discover datasets
  - No trust in metadata accuracy
  - Governance is manual

Market Need:
  Auto-catalog assets with lineage on ingestion
  Real-time quality scores published


3.5 LLM/RAG PIPELINES REQUIRE CUSTOM CODE
------------------------------------------
Current State:
  Documents → Custom parser → Custom chunker → Vector DB
  - Every team builds their own
  - Inconsistent formats
  - 40+ engineering hours per pipeline

Problems:
  - Not scalable
  - Difficult to maintain
  - No standardization

Market Need:
  Native LLM-optimized format (Markdown-KV)
  Built-in parsing, transformation, storage

DSR Request Flow (Automated):
1. Customer submits request via web form
2. Dativo API receives request
3. Identity verification email sent
4. Customer clicks verification link
5. Dativo auto-discovers all data:
   - Scans Iceberg tables
   - Scans MySQL databases
   - Scans S3 data lake
   - Scans Salesforce
   - Identifies all records with customer email/ID
6. For Download: Export → Encrypt → Presigned URL → Email
7. For Deletion:
   - Delete from Iceberg (row-level deletes)
   - Delete from MySQL (DELETE queries)
   - Rewrite S3 Parquet files (remove rows)
   - Delete from Salesforce
   - Anonymize audit logs (don't delete)
8. Verification: Re-scan all stores, confirm zero records
9. Generate certificate: Proof of deletion with digital signature
10. Email customer with certificate
